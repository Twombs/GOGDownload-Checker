# GOGDownload-Checker
A frontend program and GUI plus dropbox, that uses innoextract.exe (for EXE and partner BIN files) and 7za.exe (for ZIP files) downloaded from the GOG gaming store, as an attempt to check their integrity. Particularly useful for testing before archiving.

This is a partial replacement for the now disabled GOG Downloader, but needs to be used in conjunction with the browser downloads from the GOG site (user's game library), either with or without a third party downloading program. I use and recommend Free Download Manager 5.

See the file Notes.txt for my DISCLAIMER, and for links to required third party files and some instructions etc.
