First off, let me say I hope this works well for you, but please read my Disclaimer below.

You can install (copy) my program (GOGDownload Checker.exe) wherever you like, but 'InnoExtract' and '7-Zip' and possibly 'UnRAR' need to share the same location.

The best way to use the program, is to create a shortcut to it, and place that shortcut either on your Desktop or wherever you download your GOG games files too. That said, the floating dropbox does give you a good degree of flexibility, and it remembers its screen location.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
InnoExtract, required for testing the EXE (and companion BIN) files, can be found here - https://constexpr.org/innoextract/
(https://constexpr.org/innoextract/files/innoextract-1.8-windows.zip)
The 'innoextract.exe' file and any dependencies, need to share the same folder as my program.

7-Zip, required for ZIP & 7Z & BZ2 & SH etc files, is free and can be obtained from here - https://www.7-zip.org/
(https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z1900.exe)
If you don't wish to install it, you can grab the 7-Zip Extra: standalone console version, from here - https://www.7-zip.org/download.html
(https://www.7-zip.org/a/7z1900-extra.7z)
If you do install it, you will still need to copy the necessary files to the '7-Zip' folder inside my program's folder.

UnRAR, required for RAR files, is free and can be found here - https://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm
(https://www.rarlab.com/rar/unrarw32.exe)

QPDF, required for PDF files, is free and can be found here - https://github.com/qpdf/qpdf/releases
(More information here - http://qpdf.sourceforge.net/)


PLEASE NOTE - My program was built and tested on Windows 7 (32 Bit).


DISCLAIMER
----------
While I have gone to considerable trouble to make this program work correctly and not cause any untoward issues for users, I promise nothing, nor can you hold me responsible if you go ahead and use it. You use at your own risk.

If your Anti-Virus program reports an issue, please check my program online with Virus Total, as they run the latest updated versions of most AV programs. The programming language I use (AutoIt), often gets falsely flagged by some AV.

Cheers, Enjoy!
